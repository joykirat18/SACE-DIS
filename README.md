## Vision Statement

Travelers and explorers love to take risks experience new terrains of emotions. They also want to be an example for those who follow and tend to share their experiences through different mediums. We want to enhance, the feeling of achievement and, the experience of sharing and re-visiting experiences. They tend to attach and remember the memories of great significance to the place they experienced it. We plan to identify an innovative method with unique interactions to do and connect the place and the person more efficiently.

## Stakeholders

Adventurists: Mountaineers, Trekkers, Marathon runners, Sailers, etc.
Extreme Sports Athletes: River rafting, paragliding, wakeboarding, etc.
Explorers
Travelers

## SACE (Sharing and Celebrating Experiences)

User can drop a collection of images, text and audio data called beacon in an augmented
reality. User can save the beacons the once viewed and review them again at any other location.
Due to the presence of numerous beacons present on a single geo-location:
* The beacon can be made public or private, according to the user preference.
* The beacons can be filtered out on the basis of time of creation.

Personalised beacons to create an identity.
Map helps in exploring new reacions and finding the existing beacons

We Reiterated our features to make the application more enchance.

### How will the user

* See the beacons created by the user and others - by clicking on the play button icon
* Create a beacon - by clicking on the location icon on the screen, the user would see a blue marker
in front of them to place the beacon.
* Customize a beacon - there would be an icon on the screen that will allow the user to choose the
type of beacon according to their preference.
* Add images to the beacon - after selection the place and creating the beacon, the user would be
able to add photos by clicking on the plus icon. It will also automatically prompt up the gallery to
choose an image.
* Add audio/video to beacon - user has to follow the same steps which are written above for adding
the image to the beacon.
* Save beacons - after adding images to the beacon, the beacon place and data would
automatically save on the database.
* See their location of the nearest beacon on the map - by clicking on the map icon user would be
able to see the nearest marked icon.

## Assests Used

* Unity, AR foundation, [AR + location Asset](https://docs.unity-ar-gps-location.com/) : We used this `AR+GPS Location` asset to position 3D objects in real-world geographical locations via their GPS coordinates using Unity and Augmented-Reality .We used this asset by registering our latitude and longitude to the website by using a special script made by us .Used unity with AR foundation to create the app.

* [Image and Video Picker](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityNativeGallery) is for Android and IOS, this plugin is very useful for developers who are developing applications or names for Android/IOS in unity. Using this plugin you can pick images and video from the gallery.

* [RestClient](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/rest-client-for-unity-102501) : Simple HTTP and REST client for Unity based on Promises, also support Callbacks!

* [Google Map API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/overview) : We used google map api to show the google maps in our apps we used the google static map api and placed all our coordinates in the map .

* FireBase : Used for maintaining database of latitude , longitude and images . we uploaded latitude , longitude along with all beacon data to this database and retrieve all the data in the application back to show all the beacons in real time with the help of ar+location asset.
